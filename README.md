# Parallelization with Dask

Getting started with using dask for parallelization

This repo contains a basic example for implementing local job parallelization in python using the [dask.distributed](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/) framework.

This can also be extended to utilize [UW's center for high throughput computing](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/) for a compute cluster via the [dask-CHTC](https://dask-chtc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package.
